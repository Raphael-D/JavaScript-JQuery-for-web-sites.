Hello!


I am still practicing as web programmer.

This JavaScript is the JavaScript that can jump with the outside link.
I made it in Native without using JQuery.

A correspondence browser is modern browsers such as safari, iOS safari, chrome, firefox, ie, edge.
But in developer Tours such as chrome or ie, I do not work with the iOS mode normally.
When it reloaded it to have made a URL immutability; is not return from the present location.
Maybe I am uncongenial to the modal window of the type using the anchor link, I am careful.
If there is a bug, I'm sorry.
